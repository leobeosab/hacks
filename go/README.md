# Go hacks

## numgen.go
Generates numbers - Yeah there are better ways and no reason to do this but I like go and didn't want to download a new tool
```
â–¶ numgen
Generate number list incremented by value
numgen start end increment (optional) precision
Ex: numgen 0 10 .01
Default precision is 0 ie no decimals
```
